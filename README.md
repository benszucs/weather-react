# weather-react

Run this project locally:

2. $ npm install
3. $ npm start


Having finished a Team Treehouse track on React.js I decided to tackle my own project, without the help of tutorials.

The app is simple, the user can pick a city and the app pulls the weather for that city from the OpenWeatherMapAPI and displays it to the user. Then there is the option to generate the weather forecast for three more days.

1. Started with a clean create-react-app
2. Added components
3. Used the async function to generate data from the OpenWeatherMapAPI, parsed it to JSON
4. Using 'state' I displayed the weather forecast to user
5. Made the UI using bootstrap and CSS.
6. Added new feature to get three more days' forecast. (using same logic as above)

Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React.js
